# OSI Angle Analysis from CSV Data

This Python script processes and visualizes Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI) data from multiple CSV files, representing different Degrees of Eccentricity (DoE) and Degrees of Stenosis (DoS). The OSI data is analyzed along five angular directions (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°) to investigate shear stress patterns.

## Features

- Loads OSI data from multiple CSV files.
- Extracts OSI values at different angular positions for each spatial x-location.
- Plots comparative OSI profiles at various angles and stenosis conditions.

## Example Plot

Uncomment the single-plot section in the script to generate a detailed plot for a specific condition (e.g., DoE=100%).
